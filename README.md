## 🔍 Data Understanding

### 🧑‍⚕️ 1. Clinical Data
- **Patient Attributes:**  
  Include survival status, overall survival months, age at diagnosis, and therapy details.  
- **Sample Attributes:**  
  Provide mapping between patient IDs and biological samples (tumor/normal).  
- **Purpose:**  
  Enables correlation between **genomic profiles** and **clinical outcomes**, forming the foundation for survival and subtype analysis.

### 🧫 2. Genomic Alteration Data
- **Copy Number Alterations (CNA):**  
  Used to identify **gene amplifications or deletions** potentially driving tumorigenesis.  
- **Mutation Data (MAF):**  
  Contains **point mutations** and **small insertions/deletions** across key cancer-associated genes.  
- **Gene Panel Matrix:**  
  Acts as a **binary mask** indicating which genes were sequenced or profiled per sample.

### 🧬 3. Transcriptomic & Epigenetic Data
- **mRNA Expression (Raw + Z-Score):**  
  Quantifies **gene expression variation**, valuable for **subtype classification** and **clustering analysis**.  
- **Methylation (Promoters):**  
  Captures **epigenetic regulation** by measuring promoter methylation levels — reflecting **gene silencing** or **activation patterns** in tumor versus normal tissues.
